# What Are the Ingredients
## How to use
- A local host must be initialised using dependencies like nodemon.
- Open the client side html file using a live server.
- On the website, the name of a food and its ingredients (separated by a ", ") can be inputted and uploaded to the database using the submit button.
- All the different foods stored on the database can be accessed using the drop down selector, where the information regarding the selection will be displayed below it.
## About
In this project, an API was developed from scratch and then used to store information about the ingredients required to make different meals using javascript and express. 
A client side was also developed using a combination of javascript, html and css. This was done as part of LAP 1 of futureproof's Conway cohort.
